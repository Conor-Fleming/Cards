## Version 1
~~- total isnt displaying correct values ~~
- when an Ace occurs, need to print totals with both values of ace (1, 10)
    - this is fixed but need to work out logic to not display a value if it is over 21 
    - work out potential of multiple aces in hand?

- create function to handle "total" output
